Your Night Out 

  The purpose of the Your Night Out application is to generate an itinerary for a dinner and movie date. Once users sign up for the application with Google Authentication, they 
will have the option to provide preferences for the types of restaurant they like, and what genre of movie they enjoy watching. When the user is signed in, they can select the 
date and time they want to schedule their date. Based on the user’s location and preferences, our application will provide the user with a list of restaurants nearby, and if 
necessary, a Yelp/OpenTable link to make a reservation. 
  
  Once the restaurant is selected, our application will ask the user to provide an estimate of how long they will spend at the restaurant eating. With this information, 
our application will utilize Google Maps to provide driving directions and ETA to the nearest movie theater. Based on the time the user will arrive at the movie 
theater and their preferences, our application will provide a list of films playing at the movie theater and a Fandango link to reserve tickets/seats. After the 
restaurant, driving, and movie information have been selected, our application will provide the user with a full itinerary for their date night.
